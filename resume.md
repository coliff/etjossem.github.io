Hi, I'm Eric! I love writing responsive and semantic front end code, particularly within a clean MVC framework (think Ruby on Rails or Django). I'm always keeping an eye on new Javascript libraries as they come out, and I make full use of preprocessors (like Sass and Haml) in my workflow. I have a strong preference for small, highly collaborative teams and a development culture that values the user experience.

A web application can't survive on code alone; even as a developer, I find myself building my own mockups for projects and considering interactions carefully from the perspective of the user. I look forward to putting my understanding of event flow, typography, and usability to use in my future roles.

Does this sound like a good fit? Email me at erictj@gmail.com or tweet @etjossem.
