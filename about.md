Hi, I'm Eric. I'm currently with the web team at [SendGrid](https://www.sendgrid.com/). As the embedded front-end developer, my primary role is to bring designs to life using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I also do a bit of mobile development.

I'm a regular reader of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and GitHub contributor. I attended [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu) in my hometown, and I still feel a strong connection to the community there!

Care to get in touch? You can always email [erictj@gmail.com](mailto:erictj@gmail.com) and I'll do my best to respond.
