Hi, I'm Eric. I live on top of a hill in San Francisco (Haight-Ashbury). During the week I work with the lovely team at [Chariot](http://www.chariotsf.com/). As their lead front-end developer, my primary role is to bring designs to life using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I also do some mobile development.

I'm a regular reader of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and contributor to open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/etjossem). I attended [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu) in my hometown, and I still feel a strong connection to the community there!

Care to get in touch? You can always email [erictj@gmail.com](mailto:erictj@gmail.com) and I'll do my best to respond.
