Let's suppose you've found an [amazing local coffee stand that accepts Dogecoins](http://papa-november.com/) (DOGE), a digital currency based on a dog-related internet meme. Did you know that you can patronize this fine establishment today, without touching a single dollar bill? Trading USD for Dogecoins can be a bit confusing at first, but once you know how it works, it's much easier. In this post, we're going to buy some Dogecoins, using Bitcoin as an intermediary.

**Ingredients:** Credit or debit card + $30 + a [Dogecoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.langerhans.wallet)

To accomplish our goal, we'll be using two currency exchanges: Coinbase and Cryptsy. The first is a bridge between Bitcoin (BTC, one of the most common digital currencies) and the real world (USD or other currency, via credit or debit card). The second allows trades *between* the various digital currencies - including Bitcoin and Dogecoin - based on their relative market rates.

1. First, let's go to [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/?r=5192a818d70f992b44000088) and sign up.
2. [Buy some Bitcoins](https://coinbase.com/buys) from Coinbase with your credit card. This transaction might take a little while to clear, but we can [set up a Cryptsy account](https://www.cryptsy.com/users/register?refid=192418) in the meantime. Copy down the [Cryptsy BTC address](https://www.cryptsy.com/users/makedeposit/3); we'll need it in a moment.
3. We head back over to the [Coinbase transaction view](https://coinbase.com/transactions). Our Coinbase transaction has cleared, and we are the proud owners of $30 worth of BTC.  From here, we can transfer some or all of these Bitcoins to the Cryptsy address we copied. This step will take a little while - but it should clear in a few minutes.
4. Now let's move on to our last stop, the [Cryptsy DOGE/BTC market](https://www.cryptsy.com/markets/view/132). There's a link right next to the "Submit Buy Order" button, showing the total number of BTC you have available. We want to spend all BTC in the account, for as many Dogecoins as we can get, so click that link and submit the order.
5. When the buy order clears, copy the address from our [Dogecoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.langerhans.wallet) and [withdraw all DOGE from Cryptsy](https://www.cryptsy.com/users/makewithdrawal/94).

   That's it; you're done, and $30 of DOGE is yours.

   [...much dog money. such computers, wow!](http://f3.thejournal.ie/media/2013/12/tumblr_mvpqgvi8uy1szim6vo1_400-2.jpg)

6. (Optional) You may now buy me a delicious espresso or pour-over, if you're feeling generous. Dogecoin Wallet lets you name a US dollar equivalent (say, $2.50) and scan the recipient's QR code, so actually sending the coins is super simple.
