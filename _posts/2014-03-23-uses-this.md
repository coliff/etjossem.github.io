For development, I use a Macbook Pro 11.3 (15") with a fairly basic Dell monitor (23"). 

I code in Sublime Text 3, with a laundry list of packages to provide additional functionality.

When I was first starting out, I drove an older HP laptop with dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu. There are a few minor conveniences I miss about developing in Ubuntu's desktop environment, such as snap-to-edge windows. Fortunately, the excellent [HyperDock](http://hyperdock.bahoom.com/) replicates the same feature we know and love from Ubuntu/Windows on OSX. And for those lucky moments when I get to do cross-browser testing of IE6, [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) is more convenient than switching partitions.

Like [John McAfee](http://john.mcafee.usesthis.com/), I regularly employ extremely strong espresso and a Samsung S4 smartphone as accessory tools. That said, I do not share his interest in machine gun firmware and "research chemicals," nor have I ever had the pleasure of living in rural Belize.
